# MindFusion.Charting for JavaScript: Interactive HTML5 Charts and Gauges

## About MindFusion.Charting

MindFusion's [JavaScript Charting Library](https://mindfusion.dev/javascript-chart.html), a part of [MindFusion.JavaScript Pack](https://mindfusion.dev/javascript-pack.html), provides to **HTML5** / **JavaScript** applications the ability to create and display various kinds of **charts and gauges**. The component supports **bar, pie, doughnut, scatter, bubble, candlestick, line, area, radar and polar charts**. Many features of the chart output can be customized in a way that suits your project best. Charts can have different styles, colors, fonts and pictures. The control's programming model comprises more than 200 methods and properties.

## Getting Started

To run the samples locally:

1.  Navigate to the project root directory.
2.  Run `npm start` in your terminal. This will launch a local web server and open the samples in your default browser.

## Features

*   **Multiple Chart Types**: Supports a wide variety of chart types including bar, pie, doughnut, scatter, bubble, candlestick, line, area, radar, and polar charts.
*   **Gauges**: Create and customize oval and linear gauges.
*   **Interactivity**: Supports user interactions like zooming, panning, and moving the legend.
*   **Data Binding**: Bind charts to a list of custom objects.
*   **Customization**: Extensive customization options for styles, colors, fonts, and more.
*   **Multiple Axes**: Build plots with multiple X and Y axes.
*   **TypeScript**: Developed in TypeScript and transpiled to JavaScript.

## Source Code

A MindFusion.Charting license can be purchased with the control's complete source code. The control is being developed in TypeScript and transpiled to JavaScript.

## Samples

MindFusion.Charting comes with the following examples, which demonstrate different aspects of the control's functionality:

*   **AreaChart**: This sample demonstrates various properties of the AreaChart control. Change property values in this panel to see their effect in chart above.
*   **BarChart**: This sample demonstrates various properties of the BarChart control. Change property values in this panel to see their effect in chart above.
*   **BarChart3D**: This sample demonstrates various properties of the BarChart3D control. Change property values in tab panels to see their effect in the chart.
*   **BubbleChart**: This sample demonstrates various properties of the BubbleChart control. Change property values in tab panels to see their effect in the chart.
*   **CandlestickChart**: Demonstrates how to create a candlestick chart, used to display open, close, high and low prices of stocks for a period of time.
*   **CarGauges**: Shows how to use the gauge controls to imitate a vehicle dashboard.
*   **Clock**: Shows how to use the oval gauge to create an analog clock.
*   **Compass**: Shows how to use the oval gauge to create a compass.
*   **CustomData**: This sample shows how a list of TypeScript objects can be used directly in a chart by means of a custom series class that implements the Series interface.
*   **Dashboard**: Shows how to build a dashboard with dynamic layout.
*   **DateTimeSeries**: This sample shows how to use the DateTimeSeries class and apply different label formats.
*   **DateTimeSeriesTooltips**: This sample expands on the DateTimeSeries example by showing one way to implement custom tooltips for a chart.
*   **Equalizer**: Shows how to use linear gauges to build equalizer UI.
*   **FunnelChart**: This sample demonstrates various properties of the FunnelChart control.
*   **GroupLabels**: This sample shows how to display labels for bar groups by using the AnnotationRenderer class.
*   **Interactivity**: Use mouse click and drag to pan the chart. Dragging while pressing the CTRL key zooms the selected area of the chart. The legend can be moved too.
*   **LineChart**: This sample demonstrates various properties of the LineChart control. Change property values in this panel to see their effect in chart above.
*   **ListBinding**: This sample shows how to bind the chart to a list of custom TypeScript objects by setting the list as DataSource.
*   **MultipleAxes**: Demonstrates how to set up multiple axes.
*   **MultiplePlots**: This sample shows how to build a dashboard containing multiple plots that share a common axis.
*   **PieChart**: This sample demonstrates various properties of the PieChart control. Change property values in this panel to see their effect in chart above.
*   **RadarChart**: This sample demonstrates various properties of the RadarChart control. Change property values in this panel to see their effect in chart above.
*   **SynchronizedScroll**: Demonstrates how you can synchronize scroll positions of two plots by configuring them to use a shared Axis instance.
*   **Thermometer**: Shows how to use a linear gauge to create a thermometer.
